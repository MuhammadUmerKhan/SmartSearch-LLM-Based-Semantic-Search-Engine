● SmartSearch: LLM-Based Semantic Search Engine                                                                Personal Project | 2025
• Challenge: Traditional keyword-based search engines lack semantic depth and context, often producing noisy or
            irrelevant results.
• Action:
    • Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combining FAISS vector search, LLMs, and Google Search API
    for dynamic query resolution.
    • Implemented hybrid search by blending semantic similarity, keyword ranking, and real-time web data.
    • Optimized system performance with caching, retry logic (Tenacity), and a modular architecture for extensibility.
    • Designed plug-and-play support for vector DBs like Weaviate and Pinecone, enabling scale to large enterprise
    knowledge bases.
• Result:
    • Delivered structured, context-aware answers, cutting search time and boosting retrieval precision across domains.
    • Built for scalability and enterprise-readiness, supporting plug-and-play extensions to any vector DB or knowledge
    source.
